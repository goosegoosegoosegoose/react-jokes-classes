# What I did
- They wanted me to refractor a perfectly good hooks based react app into a class component one? Felt like I was going backwards.
- State and mapping through it caused issues, passing down functions was weird
- how to set state itself was hard to remember.

### Initialization

```
npm install && npm start
```
